# Java Avro (IDL) Kafka Schema Registry Maven Demo

This is a small demo application that accompanies my [blog post](https://jonasg.io/posts/avro-schemas-with-kafka-and-java-my-practical-workflow/) showing how to define AVRO 
schemas in AVDL and generate Java classes from them using Maven. 

It also shows how to publish those schemas onto the
Confluent Schema Registry.
